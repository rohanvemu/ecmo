Welcome to our project! We are working on a way to <span style="color:red">**non-invasively and continuously**</span> monitor coagulation status for critically ill patients on ECMO. 
 
  We believe that we can devise a method to allow better control over hemodynamic stability and vastly improve patient outcomes! 

  We are excited to invite engineering students to join us, keep reading to learn more!

st.markdown("Coagulation monitoring is key in ensuring the success of ECMO for a patient; however, it comes with a few drawbacks. Multiple coagulation panels are taken in discrete measurements every 4-12 hours and such repeated blood draws can cause further complications in critically ill patients. Since the measurements are discrete, there is potential risk of missing an immediate change in a patient coagulation status. Finally, interfacing non-biologic ECMO polyvinyl cannulas with critically ill patients with already varying levels of hemodynamic stability can create a very risky, pro-thrombotic state.")

There is a highlighted need to engineer a solution that can:
1. Reduce the number of blood draws needed
2. Continuously monitor coagulation status
3. Perform such data collection non-invasively and autonomously and display results on a mobile device.
